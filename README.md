# Female-football-players--Data-analysis
The analysis over female football players statistics

This ongoing project primarily focuses on Data Engineering and centers on the core goal of analyzing data related to women's football players collected from various online sources, with the aim of predicting the top-performing player, among other objectives (currently in progress).

The project comprises several distinct stages. Firstly, data is being collected from diverse sources and subsequently populated into a Postgres database. Following this, data preprocessing tasks are being undertaken, encompassing activities such as addressing missing data, eliminating duplicates, extracting relevant information, and converting data types.

The subsequent phase will involve conducting data analysis and generating predictions, which is also currently underway.
